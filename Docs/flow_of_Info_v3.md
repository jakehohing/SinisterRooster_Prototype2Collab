RC Game Studio

Rutgers University - Camden

Flow of Information | v3
------------------------
Hello Everyone --

While all of us are excited about the production of **Snip**, in order to make the sure the game becomes a reality, the studio needs to set certain guidelines concerning reference materials, official documentation, and the flow of information. These guidelines are meant to keep the studio organized. We hope to provide everyone with a clear idea of how draft ideas are realized through the use of Slack, Trello, the official Google account, and finally, Github.

----------

**The Flow of information:**

**SLACK** *to* **TRELLO** *to* **GOOGLE** *to* **GITHUB**

Game documentation goes through several channels before becoming official. It begins in the realm of conversation and idea, which is then complied into draft material, which is then submitted and reviewed before being published. Nothing is set in stone until it reaches the official folders, which are hosted on Google. These folders provide the materials from which our codebase is constructed. There are now four platforms through which our studio manages the flow of information: **Slack**, **Trello**, the official **Google** account, and finally, **Github**. 

Each platform has its own affordances:

(1) **Slack** is used as a community chat and sharing platform, where all studio members are encouraged to share ideas, create draft documentation, and shape the game through collaboration and exploration. Slack is our creative think-tank where every idea is considered. It’s meant to be a fun place where all studio members can communicate with one another in a low-stakes environment. Nothing created in Slack is official until it is approved by project management and later released to the official Google Drive (below).

(2) **Trello** is a planning and goal-tracking platform in which teams self-organize and assign specific responsibilities to individual members. Trello is the place where the ideas from Slack are turned into real work -- where creativity can be better managed through the setting of specific goals and responsibilities. Team leaders are expected to use Trello to keep their team members organized and on point. Project management will use Trello in order to peek on team progress, help with goal-setting, and gauge overall development.

(c) **Google** is our production channel. Once an idea makes it this far, it can be considered official working material. The Google account is used as a means of communicating these finalized ideas to the everyone involved in production. When you've finished working on a project, this is where you email your work (rcgamestudio15@gmail.com). The Google account, Drive, and Docs are all managed by the production team.

(d) **Github** is the last stop for everything -- and will host all of the code, the assets, and the documentation materials. Github essentially functions as a repository for just about everything related to the technical aspects of the game. Like the official Google account, Github hosts whatever approved assets are necessary for game development. However, since Github is much more technical than Google Drive, and also since Github hosts the codebase, it’s essentially restricted to programmers and team leads only. 

----------

*It’s important that all of us at Sinister Rooster follow these guidelines in order to make sure that ideas manifest into tangible materials. Ideas and information flow upward. Once approved, materials are uploaded to Github so that we all have a shared starting point from which to work.*

The below chart explains the process in even more detail.



**(1) SLACK | FOR COMMUNICATION**

https://rcgamestudio.slack.com

Studio & team messaging, general conversation, draft sharing, and think-tank.

 - Slack is the communication platform through which all members of the studio are expected to communicate. Slack channels have been created for teams to self-organize, share ideas, and work on draft projects. All files and conversations shared in slack are considered as drafts.
 - Channels for individual teams are just that: for individual teams. Cross-posting from #programming to #art is discouraged. If programmers want to communicate with artists, such conversations should take place in #general. The same rule applies to all other teams.
 - The #team-leads channel has been created as a place where individual team leaders and producers can come together discuss progress, work through problems and find solutions. This is a restricted channel for team leads and product management only.
 - The #project-management is a restricted channel for producers only. Teams leads are asked to communicate with project management either in #team-leads, by messaging, or through our official Google email.
 - The #announcements channel is for project managers and producers only. It serves as a place where producers can communicate official announcements to the studio as a whole. Please do not post in this channel unless you are a member of #project-management.
 - The #general channel has been created as a place where all studio members can come together and discuss ideas about the game, the studio, and other Snip-related ideas. Everyone is welcome to participate and share ideas about the game.
 - The #random channel has been created as a place where all studio members can come together and discuss non-game related things.

----------
**(2) TRELLO | FOR TRACKING**

https://trello.com/

Team-specific goals, deadlines, planning, tracking, and transparency.

 - Trello is the planning platform and tracking in which teams are expected to post specific goals, delegate specific responsibilities to team members, and track specific progress in order to make sure that overall goals are met.
 - Every team has their own official Trello board, which is moderated by the team leader. Teams can organize their Trello board in whatever way that works best for them.
 - Individual teams do not have the ability to cross-post (or even see) other boards unless they are invited to participate by respective team leaders.
 - Project management (producers) are able to see and modify all boards.
 - Project management is encouraged to use Trello as a means to track the progress of the studio as a whole and to make sure everything is headed in the right direction.


----------
**(3) GOOGLE | FOR PRODUCTION**

Email: rcgamestudio15@gmail.com

Google Drive Official: https://goo.gl/1WQt6X

Official approved assets, communications, and marketing.

 - The official Google account to which you can email your finalized ideas and communicate directly with project management. 
 - Project management uses this account in order to keep the draft materials more organized (so we don't have to rummage through Slack in order to make sense of where the studio stands).
 - The Google account and associated email and official folders are restricted to project management. They are to be used for official communication only, file-sharing, and other studio-wide needs.

----------
**(4) GITHUB | FOR PROGRAMMING**

https://github.com/SR-Steve/SinisterRooster_Prototype2Collab

The last step, final product resources, assets and CODE.

- Once material makes it through Google, and once it is made official, it will be pushed to Github.
- Our Github repository is the last stop in this chain of information. But since Github is fairly technical, and since not everyone needs to be familiar with git commands, access to Github push is limited to programmers and team leads only.
- Programmers are encouraged to double-check the official Google account in order to make sure that what is being pushed to Git is in accord with the official and approved documentation. Of course it’s inevitable that some things on Github will not be on Google, but it’s important to make sure that our shared vision is cohesive.
- If you have any questions about git, don’t be afraid to ask.


----------
The producers want to thank everyone involved in the creation of Snip. We also want to remind everyone that all ideas are important and without collaborative creativity none of this would be possible. We also want to state that face-to-face team meetings are also an important element in the creative process. Such meetings should be documented in order that nothing is lost.

With a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work, we are certain that we can make Snip an amazing experience for all of us. If for any reason you feel like your ideas are not being heard, or if you feel as though you are being left of out of the loop, please let us know immediately. We want production of Snip to be both fun and exciting for everyone!

Thank you all for your hard work and great ideas,

**Project Management**
